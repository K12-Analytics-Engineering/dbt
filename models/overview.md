# Ed-Fi data marts

The data marts and models found in this documentation largely reflect Ed-Fi's Analytics Middle Tier. There are some places where additional columns or entirely new data models were added. The documentation will always note when this is the case. This documentation should serve as a companion guide to Ed-Fi's [official documentation](https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/display/EDFITOOLS/AMT+User+Guide).
